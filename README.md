## Problem Statement and Data Summary ##

Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic is positive, negative, or neutral.
COVID-19 originally known as Coronavirus Disease of 2019, has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020.
The study analyzes various types of tweets gathered during the pandemic times hence can be useful in policy making to safeguard the countries by demystifying the pertinent facts and information.


## Approach ##

1)  familiarized and cleaned the data by doing preliminary analysis, and dealt with null values
3)  performed EDA 
4) Removed html tags and unwanted words from the text data. Tokenization and stemming functions are applied
5) Extracted hashtags belonging to different classes 
6) Used count vectorization for  vectorizing the tweet text
7) implemented multiple classification models for multi and binary  class classification
## Result ##
We built a classification model that predicts the sentiment of tweets with an accuracy score of 74%
